# Vehicle-Recommendation-System

## Vision :

To create a software of the campus junta to help them see all the information of IITG Buses and E-Rickshaws and also contain all information of the drivers in case someone wants to contact them.
We also aim to provide the users a best available option depending on their journey, ie. If  aparticular driver is more experienced in going to Shillong, he will be given an edge over the others in displaying his information.

### Technologies that we will use : 
1. Visual Basic 2013
2. MS Access 2016 ( for backend part )

### Day 1: 30 th January
We discussed all the feautures that we plan to incorporate in our project.
Due to the complexity issues, some features have been kept for the version 2 and will be implemented if time permits.

The outline of the project has been finalised and shared.

##### Contribution : 
Everyone except Sandeep Naidu( 160101041 ) was present today. We also discussed the key features as a team. 
All the five members have given their valuable ideas.
Signatures of the members has been taken for record.

###### Mayank : 
Suggested to incorporate a portal for the staff members. The staff members can update their profile and will be given an oppurtunity to add and delete users ie. cab drivers and e-rickshaw waalas. The staff members will also be allowed to delete a particular user based on his/her name. He took the responsibility to write the log file for the day.

###### Annanye :
Annanye suggested that we should have different forms for the people who want to travel within the campus , ie. via e-rickshaws and buses and for those who want to take cabs,etc. He also suggested to have a form for outstation drivers which will display the drivers information according to the place the user wants to visit.

###### Aviral :
Aviral suggested to have forms for the people who wants to travel from/to the campus . The user will be given a chance to select according to the case whether he wants to travel form the city or to the city. If the user wnats to go to the city, he will be shown a full list of all the respective drivers who are willing to take the journey. 

###### Rohan :
Rohan suggested to have a form for incampus travel and portals in case of emergencies. In case of emergency, we will display the contaact details of the ambulance.For the incampus travel we will display e-rickshaw drivers informations and also show the next bus available from the system's current time. He took the required signatures.

###### Aranya :
Aranya suggested to have a different portal for the cab drivers and the e-rickshaw drivers. The drivers will be given a chance to update their profile information like contact details and password, etc. The drivers can also add information if their cab is booked.
They will add details like source, destiantion and occupancy if their cab is booked.  

### Day 2: 1st February:
We met and discussed the problems that we can face if we use MySQL as the RDBMS. So we came to a conclusion that we should use MS Access as our database management system. We divided all our work into two and formed the respective groups.

The first group was given the responsibility of handling the portals for staff, drivers(both cab and e-rickshaws) and in campus travel.

The second group took up the duty for creating forms for displaying all the information for out campus travel, ie, by bus, cabs . This group also decided to work on creating the form for outstation travel.

Rohan, Aranya and Mayank comprised the first group and the latter work was taken up by Annanye and Aviral.

We then dispersed and met in our individual groups to work further.

Mayank and Annanye both decided to maintain the log file for the day. And the signatures were taken by Rohan.

### Day 3: 4th February:
The register portal of the staff was created and there were some major discussions on the to city and from city portal. Major revisions in the database. Login Portal for the drivers was created. Classes for query checking were created. Outstation was created. The bus portal is under construction. 

Contribution:
Everyone except Sandeep Naidu (160101041) was present today. We also discussed the key features as a team.
There were many major revisions:

Aviral: Suggested the change in the form structure. Now the main part will consist of outstation, city and in-campus. Worked on the outstation part of the forms. Worked with Annanya in implementing the query classes and in designing the city part of the forms.
Implemented the bus part of the city form. This will show the next available bus on the basis of the current time and date. Part of the discussionon the database. Implemented the find(search) in the outstation.

Annanya: Made the cab booking algorithm. Suggested changes in the database. Now the database will consist of a booking table that will 
hold all the bookings with their ids. This with the help of status check box will help in implementing sharing of cabs. We will also account for the timings and scheduling of the cabs. Now we would also have to delete all the records of the past day. Designed with aviral the layout of the the city part and implemented with aviral the query classes. Created the log file for the day.

Mayank: Created the whole login page for the staff. Handled all the error exceptions in the login page for the staff. Worked on three major parts. Adding the driver to the database. Also worked on updating the profiles. Handled deletion of profiles from the database. The names to be deleted will be taken as an input and respective querries were executed. He will be responsible for the integration part of the project.

Aranya: Created the login portal for the cab drivers. This will handle all the profile information. This will help the driver in updating his or her info and will also help in updating his or her status. Designed its layout. The Feature of adding/removing places where a cab driver visits out of station has also been added in the form . Also, the feature of ON Duty / OFF Duty has been added in the form which helps the user to tell whether the given cab driver is working currently or not. 

Rohan: Helped in designing the forms. Worked with Aviral on the login page. Created the first draft of the database which includes many tables like cabdata which contains information like username,password,their mobile numbers and so on, offcampus bus data which inccludes timing, working days,source and destination,incampus bus data which includes timing, source and destination and emergency data.


## What will we be working on now?

We have decided to work on the front end to improve the UI/UX of the form. 
We are planning to present a workable model by Thursday-Friday.
Mayank has taken the responsibility to integrate all the forms into one.
