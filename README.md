# Vehicle-Recommendation-System

## Vision :
To create a software of the campus junta to help them see the location of IITG Buses and E-Rickshaws and also contain all information of the drivers in case someone wants to contact them.

### Technologies that we will use : 
1. Visual Basic 2013
2. MS Access 2016 ( for backend part )

### Day 1: 30 th January
We discussed all the feautures that we plan to incorporate in our project.
Due to the complexity issues, some features have been kept for the version 2 and will be implemented if time permits.

The outline of the project has been finalised and shared.

##### Contribution : 
Everyone except Sandeep Naidu( 160101041 ) was present today. We also discussed the key features as a team. 
All the five members have given their valuable ideas.
Signatures of the members has been taken for record.

###### Mayank : 
Suggested to incorporate a portal for the staff members. The staff members can update their profile and will be given an oppurtunity to add and delete users ie. cab drivers and e-rickshaw waalas. The staff members will also be allowed to delete a particular user based on his/her name. He took the responsibility to write the log file for the day.

###### Annanye :
Annanye suggested that we should have different forms for the people who want to travel within the campus , ie. via e-rickshaws and buses and for those who want to take cabs,etc. He also suggested to have a form for outstation drivers which will display the drivers information according to the place the user wants to visit.

###### Aviral :
Aviral suggested to have forms for the people who wants to travel from/to the campus . The user will be given a chance to select according to the case whether he wants to travel form the city or to the city. If the user wnats to go to the city, he will be shown a full list of all the respective drivers who are willing to take the journey. 

###### Rohan :
Rohan suggested to have a form for incampus travel and portals in case of emergencies. In case of emergency, we will display the contaact details of the ambulance.For the incampus travel we will display e-rickshaw drivers informations and also show the next bus available from the system's current time. He took the required signatures.

###### Aranya :
Aranya suggested to have a different portal for the cab drivers and the e-rickshaw drivers. The drivers will be given a chance to update their profile information like contact details and password, etc. The drivers can also add information if their cab is booked.
They will add details like source, destiantion and occupancy if their cab is booked.  

### Day 2: 1st February:
We met and discussed the problems that we can face if we use MySQL as the RDBMS. So we came to a conclusion that we should use MS Access as our database management system. We divided all our work into two and formed the respective groups.

The first group was given the responsibility of handling the portals for staff, drivers(both cab and e-rickshaws) and in campus travel.

The second group took up the duty for creating forms for displaying all the information for out campus travel, ie, by bus, cabs . This group also decided to work on creating the form for outstation travel.

Rohan, Aranya and Mayank comprised the first group and the latter work was taken up by Annanye and Aviral.

We then dispersed and met in our individual groups to work further.

Mayank and Annanye both decided to maintain the log file for the day. And the signatures were taken by Rohan.

##### Day 4: 4th February:
The register portal of the staff was created and there were some major discussions on the to city and from city portal. Major revisions in the database. Login Portal for the drivers was created. Classes for query checking were created. Outstation was created. The bus portal is under construction.
